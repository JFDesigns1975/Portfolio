<h1>How to Pencil Spin</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Learning how to spin a pencil is not the easiest thing to do. But, the
    best things in life never are!</p>
<h1>What is Pencil Spinning?</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pencil spinning is when you take your 5 fingers and a pencil and
    spin the pencil in circular motion around your fingers.
<h1>Steps to Pencil Spin</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hold the pencil between your index finger,
    middle finger, and thumb. Grasp your pencil
    in your dominant hand - your index and middle
    finger should be spaced apart from each other by
    about the width of your thumb. In other words,
    if the pencil was not there, your thumb should
    be able to fit comfortably between your index
    and middle fingers.</p>

<p>Pull with your middle finger like a trigger.
    In this trick, your middle finger provides
    most of the energy for spinning the pencil.
    Gripping the pencil between your thumb,
    index, and middle fingers as described
    above, pull or flick your middle finger
    inwards as if you were pulling the trigger
    of a gun. Ideally, this will cause your
    pencil to begin turning around your thumb.
    If you're having trouble getting the pencil
    around your thumb, re-examine your grip - if
    your middle finger and thumb are aligned too
    closely to each other, you may be pulling
    the pencil into your thumb, rather than
    around it</p>

<p>Roll your wrist to help get the pencil around
    your thumb. Beginners usually experience
    trouble spinning pencils at the outset.
    Often, they have difficulty getting the
    pencil to turn completely around the thumb.
    To make this easier, try rolling your wrist
    as you pull with your middle finger.
    Gently turn your wrist (as if you were
    Gently turn your wrist (as if you were
    turning a doorknob) away from your
    body as you make your "pull". This
    imparts added momentum on the pencil,
    and, as an added benefit, helps to keep
    your fingers out of the path of the spinning
    pencil.</p>

<p>Move your fingers out of the way, or they
    will block the pencil's spin. When you're
    learning how to spin a pencil, it's
    important to be conscious of the positions
    of your fingers after the initial "pull"
    from your middle finger. One common
    mistake among beginners is to unknowingly
    obstruct the path of the spinning pencil
    with their index or middle finger.
    There are several techniques for
    keeping your fingers out of the way -
    two are listed below</p>

<p>Catch the pencil. The most impressive part
    of spinning a pencil isn't necessarily the
    spinning pencil itself - it's the fact that
    the person spinning the pencil is able to
    effortlessly catch the pencil and repeat
    the trick over and over. Once you've
    gotten the hang of spinning your pencil,
    work on "catching" the pencil without
    fumbling it. After one turn, angle the spin
    of your pencil into the side of your
    middle finger. As it makes contact with
    your middle finger, use your thumb and
    index finger to support the pencil from
    opposite sides.</p>
