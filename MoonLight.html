    <h2>Moon Light Madness</h2>
    <p>The lunar phase or Moon phase is the shape of the Moon's directly sunlit portion as viewed from Earth.
        The lunar phases gradually change over a synodic month (about 29.53 days) as the Moon's orbital positions
        around Earth and Earth around the Sun shift. The visible side of the moon is variously sunlit, depending on
        the position of the Moon in its orbit. Thus, this face's sunlit portion can vary from 0% (at new moon) to 100%
        (at full moon). Each of the four "intermediate" lunar phases (see below) is approximately 7.4 days, with slight
        variation due to the Moon's orbit's elliptical shape.<br><br>There are four principal lunar phases: the new moon,
        first quarter, full moon, and last quarter (also known as third or final quarter), when the Moon's ecliptic
        longitude is at an angle to the Sun (as viewed from the centre of the Earth) of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, respectively
        [1][a] Each of these phases appears at slightly different times at different locations on Earth. During the intervals
        between principal phases are intermediate phases, during which the Moon's apparent shape is either crescent or gibbous.
        On average, the intermediate phases last one-quarter of a synodic month, or 7.38 days.[b] The descriptor waxing is used
        for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to a full moon, and waning when the
        shape is thinning. The longest duration between full moon to new moon (or new moon to full moon) lasts about 15 days
        and 14+1⁄2 hours, while the shortest duration between full moon to new moon (or new moon to full moon) lasts only about
        13 days and 22+1⁄2 hours.<br><br>When the Moon as seen from Earth is a thin crescent, Earth as viewed from the Moon is
        almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from
        Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called earthshine and sometimes
        picturesquely described as "the old moon in the new moon's arms" or "the new moon in the old moon's arms".</p>
